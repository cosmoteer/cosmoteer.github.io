			Hello, I'm Raghava Ravi. I'm from Cupertino, California and I've seemed to have caught 
				the software bug from living in Silicon Valley. I'm very much interested in 
				the new cloud tecnologies, having worked with AWS at my past internship. I'm 
				also looking into other software development in C++, Java, C, and Python.
				Outside of school, I'm into astronomy, bicycling, photography, and personal 
				projects (like this website). I'm currently the secretary of UIAS, my university 
				astronomy club, and have been an astronomy outreach volunteer back home for over 
				five years. Scroll through on the right to find out more or send me a message 
				if you are interested in working with me.
